# Genre
A simple project I created to familiarise myself with the basic API build.
This repository is basically a simple API build with a node.js package called *express*. This uses all the basic requests HTTP requests to update, replace, delete or show the genre to the client.
A part of the Cupidity API task assigned to me, I studied the given task and created my own small project around it.

## Built with
 - Express - back end web application framework for Node.js
 - Joi - allows us to create blueprints of Javascript objects that ensure that we process and ultimately accept accurate data.
